# Launch Todo List

## Immediate Priority: Make mobile app usable for my social media
- [ ] Improve the loading screen when you click to slide show
- [ ] One more feautre to add context to the logged in user so the slide show is
- [ ] Make the templates look amazing
- [ ] Revise server-side rendering to ensure text formatting matches edit menu
- [ ] Fix background rendering consistency between server and client
- [] How to get this deployed to my phone and using the Vercel API? So I don't have to have the server running locally




## Mobile app enhancements
- [ ] Add login to the app / supabase auth
- [ ] One more feautre to add context to the logged in user so the create is smarter
- [ ] Improve the loading screen when you click to slide show

## Server-Side Rendering & API Development

- [ ] Fix background rendering consistency between server and client
- [ ] Ensure all visual elements replicate correctly in server-side rendering
- [ ] Focus on getting API server-side rendering working reliably
- [ ] Implement reusable API endpoints for future website front-end integration
- [ ] Test server-side rendering across different slideshow formats
- [ ] Optimize server-side rendering performance
- [ ] Prepare API architecture for website front-end implementation

## Future Website Integration

- [ ] Design API structure to support website front-end
- [ ] Ensure API endpoints are reusable across mobile and web platforms
- [ ] Document API endpoints for website development
- [ ] Plan website front-end architecture using existing API

## Webiste creation
- [ ] Supabase Authentication 
- [ ] Extend API for CRUD user/org 
- [ ] Vite js, tailwind, schadcn ui components
- [ ] Slick menu design
- [ ] Perhaps the main logedin page is a page with library and slide shows
- [ ] Have a quick AI create feature like the mobile app
- [ ] Think about way to create slidehsows in bulk and bulk download (maybe in folders or something) Thnk about future integration with a chat bot via n8n integration, or an agent that can call this endpoint to create 1 or many slide shows, each containing 3-5 slides. And the agent would essentiall plan the theme for each slide and write the text based on a conversation with the user. But the standalone feautre, we need to think how that would work in the UI. If we get this right, it means creators can use the same image library to create many different natrrative slide shows.
- [ ] Think about subscription model and payment gateway, define plans etc setup tables
- [ ] Same main features, add context, photo library and slide shows. Which is all shared accross mobile and web app.
